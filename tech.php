				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Javascript</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">It's good stuff and getting better all the time. I never could have predicted my fervour for destructuring, and I'm always trying to push my usage of ES6+'s async options.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">CSS</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Writing css is my bread and butter. What most excites me is the advance of CSS grid, but that's not to say devs should overlook backwards compatability. Speaking of which, I've learnt the hard way that no, IE11 does not have proper flexbox support.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">CSS Architecture</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">I mention this seperately because no matter how fancy your CSS is, you need make sure it's gonna play nicely at scale. Personally I've used a lot of BEM, but I don't think that's the only way to go about things.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">React.js</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Good results, great workflow, but best of all it encourages good practices. By contrast, I have a distant memory of using Angular 1x and I'm fairly sure its a traumatic one.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Redux</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Brilliant, deliberate state management.</p>

			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">DevTools</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Basically the swiss army knife of front-end development, perfect for debugging and performance optimisation.</p>

			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Web Animation</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">I want to be doing more of it. A couple of years ago I put a fair chunk of time into velocity.js, but more recently I've been using GSAP.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Express.js</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Recently I've been using Express.js to develop a RESTful API to serve a songwriting web React application.</p>

				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">PWA</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Or Progressive Web Applications. For the record, I DON'T have experience using the service worker API yet&hellip; Nevertheless, having read quite a bit about them, it seems to me that service workers point to is the future where web and native apps converge.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">AMP</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Or Accelerated Mobile Pages. It turns out it's pretty fun stripping out all the fluff to make a super-fast page. Also I was surprised with how much interactivity you can achieve with it's simple state management system.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Visual Studio Code</h2>
