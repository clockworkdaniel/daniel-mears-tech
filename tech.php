			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Javascript</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">It's good stuff and getting better all the time. I'm always using more of ES2015's features, though I do have mixed feelings about arrow functions...</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">CSS</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Writing css is my bread and butter. What most excites me is the advance of CSS grid, but that's not to say you should ever overlook backwards compatability.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">CSS Architecture</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">I mention this seperately because no matter how nice your CSS is, you need make sure it's gonna play nicely at scale.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">React.js</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Good results, great workflow, unlike Angular 1x which I found turned a quagmire all too quickly.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Redux</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Brilliant, deliberate state management, makes React even better.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">DevTools</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Basically the swiss army knife of front end development, perfect for debugging and performance optimisation.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Canvas</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Leaving the DOM behind is daunting, but pays off when it comes to animation performance. That said, next time around I'd probably use a purpose-built framework to interface with the Canvas API.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Web Animation</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">I want to be doing more of it. A couple of years ago I put a fair chunk of time into velocity.js, but I reckon GSAP is the way to go now.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">PWA</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Or Progressive Web Applications. For the record, I DON'T have direct experience in using service worker API... Nevertheless, having read quite a bit about them, it seems to me that service workers point to is the future where web and native apps converge.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">AMP</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Or Accelerated Mobile Pages. It turns out it's pretty fun stripping out all the fluff to make a super-fast page. Also I was surprised with how much interactivity you can achieve with it's simple state management system. Looks more interesting when combined with PWA technologies.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">MVT</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">I'm Maxymiser trained... turns out I don't have much else to say about it :D</p>
			</li>
			<li class="tech-list__item trigger-on-scroll" data-trigger-point="0.1">
				<h2 class="tech-list__heading">Game Dev</h2>
				<p class="tech-list__copy">Tried my hand at this for the first time this year, using the Canvas API. A lot of fun.</p>
